# Titanic_survival_prediction

## Description

This repository contains Python code for predicting whether a passenger would survive the sinking of the Titanic or not. The project is part of the Kaggle Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster competition. The challenge of the competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on passenger data like age, sex, class, etc.

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- pandas
- numpy
- sklearn

The required files:

- [gender_submission.csv](https://github.com/SAI-07/Titanic_survival_prediction/files/11506725/gender_submission.csv)

- [train.csv](https://github.com/SAI-07/Titanic_survival_prediction/files/11506727/train.csv)

## Conclusion

A machine learning regression model to predict survival of passsengers with accuracy of 0.9234
